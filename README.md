## End to End Data Science Project
# Project Summary

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting math scores for students using a combination of data science techniques and machine learning algorithms.

## Key Highlights
- **Data Ingestion:** Utilized SQL for efficient data ingestion from the database.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering:** Conducted thorough EDA and engineered relevant features to enhance model performance.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:**
  - Implemented various algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and boosting techniques.
  - Achieved an outstanding R2 score of 88.28% for math score prediction.
- **MLOps Implementation:**
  - Leveraged MLflow, DVC, and Dagster for seamless model deployment and management.
- **Web Application Development:**
  - Developed a user-friendly web application using Flask framework.
  - Provided stakeholders with easy access to predictive insights.

## Repository Structure
- `/data`: Contains datasets used in the project.
- `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, modeling, and evaluation.
- `/scripts`: Scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and deployment.
- `/webapp`: Source code for the Flask-based web application.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd project`
3. Set up the environment and install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Explore the notebooks in `/notebooks` for data analysis and model development.
5. Run the scripts in `/scripts` for data preprocessing, model training, and deployment.
6. Start the web application by running `python web_app.py` .
